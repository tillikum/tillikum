Configuration
=============

1. Copy `local.config.php.dist` to `local.config.php`
2. Make changes to `local.config.php`. You may override anything you find in any
   other files. If you need to create configuration fragments, you may do so. The
   version control configuration is set up to ignore `*local.config.php`, so use
   that suffix.
